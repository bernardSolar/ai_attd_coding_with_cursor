# ATDD with AI Experiment

## Overview

This repository hosts an experiment in Acceptance Test-Driven Development (ATDD) conducted by an AI assistant. 
The goal is to demonstrate how AI can follow rigorous software engineering methodologies while providing clear evidence of the development process.

## Purpose

This experiment aims to:

1. Evaluate an AI assistant's ability to follow strict ATDD principles
2. Create a transparent, verifiable development process
3. Demonstrate best practices in test-driven development
4. Provide educational value for understanding ATDD methodology

## The Challenge

The AI is tasked with building a simple appointment scheduling application while adhering to pure ATDD methodology:

- Starting with only high-level user scenarios
- Writing failing tests before any implementation
- Implementing minimal code to make each test pass
- Documenting each step of the process with clear evidence
- Following a strict red-green-refactor cycle

## Verification

The repository itself serves as evidence of the AI's development process. You can verify ATDD adherence by:

1. Reviewing the commit history in chronological order
2. Confirming tests were committed before implementation
3. Verifying each implementation commit addresses a specific failing test
4. Examining the detailed development log with timestamps and SHA references

## Conclusion

This experiment explores the intersection of AI capabilities and software engineering methodologies. 
The results demonstrate how AI systems can potentially augment human developers by following established best practices while providing transparent evidence of their process.
